          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started to learn code in high school becaues I really enjoy video games, but shifted away from wanting to get into game dev and went towards web and software development as I felt developing websites and applications for helping people sounded exciting.</p>

          <h3>Volleyball</h3>
          <p>I started playing volleyball in April 2021 and I have been able to improve a lot at it. I took initiative to learn from videos online, from friends I made at the places I play at and just through trial and error while playing. I have been able to make many connections with people I have met and have taken initiative to lead teams and extra play sessions so everyone can play more and improve together.</p>
